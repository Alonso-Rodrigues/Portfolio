🛠️ This is my portfolio in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
✒️ A project in which I was able to develop some skills in the front-end area and two sites that I worked on during my internships at the University in France.
🙌 I am very grateful to Metz Numeric School for everything I learned and to the two companies where I was able to work during my internships.
🎁 I would greatly appreciate your feedback.
🙏 Feel free to download the project.
